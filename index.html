    <p>
    My name is Brody and I'm finding this coding stuff exciting. The hardest thing so far seems to be debugging my code.
    Although it is challenging I am still getting better every day. Ive been practicing everyday
    since I found out that I was accepted to the bootcamp.

    <p>
    lately, I've been playing modded instances of Minecraft: Java Edition. Since Java Edition is open source, the
    possibilities and mods at my disposal are limitless from deep arcane blood magic to high science airships.

    Here's a few fun facts about me:
        <ul>
        <li>When I have a 50/50 shot, the odds are 80/20 in my favor.</li>
        <li>My two cents are worth $37 in change.</li>
        <li>I can cook minute rice in 57 seconds.</li>

    </ul>
