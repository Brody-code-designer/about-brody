    My name is Brody and im finding this coding stuff pretty hard. The hardest thing seems to be making small
    mistakes and finding them. Although it is hard I am still making progress every day. Ive been practicing everyday
    since I found out that this bootcamp was happening. Practicing seems to really make coding possible.

    Playing Minecraft has been pretty fun to me lately. Although I haven't got to play since I started practicing
    coding, I look forward to being able to play when we are all done with the bootcamp. Since I have a computer I
    started downloading fun addons and mods to Minecraft Java edition. It gives the game way better graphics
    like realistic water. There are also cool modpacks like zombie mode that make for some nice challenges.

    In the future, I hope to start a career building websites. Ive always wanted to build stuff, but never thought it
    might be websites. Im looking forward to learning how to use developer tools!
